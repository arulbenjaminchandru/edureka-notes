Benefits of this approach:
    (1) A large team can easily work on various modules and Components paralelly
    (2) In future of you want to enhance
        - its super easy
    (3) can test the indiviual Components separately
    (4) if one component does'nt work, the entire application does not come down


    Decorators
    export someClass {}

Module: is to group certain functionality

    @NgModule({
        
    })
    export class someClass {}


Component: Can control certain section on the screen
    M : deal with the data
    V : template (HTML file)
    C : the logic we write (.ts)

    @Component({
        
    })
    export class someClass {}


Service

    @Injectable({
        
    })
    export class someClass {}


Every Angular application will have
    (1) atleast 1 module
    (2) atleast 1 component

on Start:
    (1) main.ts ------> App module
    (2) App module ------> App component

-> to start an angular application: ng serve
-> to stop an angular application: press ctrl + c

Amazon:
    Modules
        App Module
    Component
        App component

        Header Component - manually create
            template
            ts 
        Products Component - create with cli
        Footer Component - create with cli
            > ng generate component <name_of_component>
